# CGSM 
A sorting method invented for the condition of doubly linked list data structure. The cost is in O(n log n) times.

# Card Game Sorting Method

# Introduction

The sorting algorithm is the essential method to computer science in use today. Here we introduce a new method in O(n log n) at worst-case Which derived from Merge sorting and Tournament method. Moreover this method is exclusively used for the data structure the doubly linked list. We call Card Game Sorting Method or CGSM.

# Compiling and Executing Platform

This code was edited, compiled and debug on Code::Blocks, Version 12.11. The procedure implemented in console platform C++. About the detail compiler, please visit this website: http://www.codeblocks.org for more information.

# Detail This Central Thought-way

The CGSM’s implementing is getting around a core engine the Merge Method that with two small subsequences, via executing two functions that of merger and sorting in the intermediate course to achieve the task of sorting in a doubly linked list.
In fact, the algorithm simultaneously addresses two sequences and their members via for each member in one sequence to seek an interval in another sequence for inserted. The method is not profound but can in full measure reuse the information about two sequences in a strict ascent. 

# Detail in Code

In source code, we just simply take an instance to express author’s thought. Over there, we define a 2nd dimension array to present an array with the structure as the pattern of index to key; and a double linked list to backup those relations among items in a linear table which is common in use as a kind of compact data structure.
By a class to contain the data structure and functions, program slightly works out a sorting with those items. So we emphasize again: this code is just a paradigm of scholar research works; because author only just define a group of natural numbers as keys as objects operated in our experiment; if you want to apply this algorithm on your practice, please to reform her on your purpose.
